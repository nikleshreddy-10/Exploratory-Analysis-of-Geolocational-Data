# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Geolocational-Data
This project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best accommodation for students (city of your choice) by classifying accommodation for incoming students on the basis of their preferences on amenities, budget and proximity to the location.


Step 1: Collect Data And Set Up The Environment :
If we want to do data analysis, we need to get the dataset and we need to setup 	the environment required for data analysis. It requires jupyter notebook to do 	analysis.

Step 2:Data Cleaning And Visualization :
After getting the data and understand what it says. A best way to do this is by 	visualizing, the data via graphs. Graphs help us quickly get an easy 	understanding of the data, and are a much more User-friendly.

Step 3: Pre-Processing Of Data :
K Means Clustering will help us cluster the places based on the facilities 	located around them. A location with more facilities nearby will be said as 	â€œAmenity Rich" while a location with less facilities will be said as "Amenity 	Poor". Similar locations will be grouped .Run the K-Means Clustering 	 	Algorithm and find out the best value for K, which we will use on our website.

Step 4: Get Geo-Locational Data From Foursquare API :
After getting the best cluster values, we need to get geo-locational data from 	the Foursquare API to find these people some accommodation for our users.

Step 5: Plot The Clusters On The Map : 
At last plot the results on the map that will the user to view the locations.
